# documentation of the dead darflen theory

## introduction

this repository documents the "dead darflen theory," a belief prevalent among some users of ["darflen"]. the core tenet of this theory is the assertion that the vast majority of user accounts are not operated by distinct individuals but are instead "alts" (alternative accounts) controlled by a much smaller group of real people. specifically, the theory posits that out of a perceived user base of nearly 1000, only approximately 17 are genuine, unique individuals.

## background and context

the "dead darflen theory" emerged from a growing suspicion among people like me (jcole) and other people regarding the authenticity of interactions and the perceived homogeneity of viewpoints on the platform. this suspicion was fueled by observations of accounts that seemed to appear and disappear rapidly, exhibited strikingly similar posting styles despite having different usernames, and engaged in what appeared to be highly coordinated responses or "pile-ons" against dissenting opinions. proponents of the theory often point to these patterns of seemingly inauthentic behavior, the lack of genuinely diverse perspectives on certain topics, and the feeling that many interactions lack the spontaneity and individuality expected from a large and varied user base.

this belief stands in stark contrast to the platform's apparent user count of nearly 1000, creating a significant perceived discrepancy between the number of visible accounts and the number of alleged real individuals operating them.

## core principles

the "dead darflen theory" generally revolves around the following core principles:

* prevalence of alts: the overwhelming majority of accounts are not unique users but are controlled by a small number of individuals.
* limited real users: the actual number of distinct individuals on the platform is significantly lower than the reported user count, estimated to be around 17.
* coordinated activity: the perceived coordinated behavior or interconnectedness of many accounts is cited as evidence of centralized control.
* statistic manipulation: the art of using alternate accounts to boost yourself higher than other people actually using the platform.

## evidence and arguments (as perceived by proponents)

* qxva: he has used his deleted *alts* to create anarchy communities before asking Paradock to delete the accounts.
* his alternate accounts:

* just perceived lack of genuine, diverse interactions or perspectives on the platform.
* anecdotal experiences of encountering accounts that seem automated or controlled in a similar manner.
* statistical anomalies in user activity or engagement.


## open questions and areas for further "investigation" (within the context of the belief)

* what are the alleged motivations behind the creation and maintenance of so many alt accounts?
* are there specific patterns of activity that are considered more indicative of alt accounts?
